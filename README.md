The payment should be through this website if I'm not mistaken. I don't know what to put here...

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
I have a lot of code already written for the first step (Github link below), I am just struggling to figure out how to arrange them into header and CPP files to get them to work right. I am very new to this and trying to teach myself as I go along. I hope this is not a very complicated problem for an experienced programmer. All of this needs to be C++ in case I need to mention that here.

Here is what I am working with:
https://github.com/DoubleMK1738/Project5.git

First, I need to create a binary tree class, this class should be generic so that it will operate on any given type. Then I need to take that class and create an AVL tree.

The class needs to have the following functionality:

insert: Insert a node into the proper location of the tree
remove: Remove a specific node from the tree
contains: Report is the tree contains a specific piece of data
findMin: Find and return the smallest value in the tree
findMax: Find and return the largest value in the tree
isEmpty: Determine if the tree is empty
printTree: Visit each node in the tree and print the data to the screen.

Then, using the code created in the first step as a guide, create an AVL tree. If done properly, there should be a great deal of functionality from the Binary Tree class and add the code to balance the tree. The class should balance the tree whenever a node is inserted or removed. This means it will probably have to keep track of when a sub-tree is taller and shorter than the other. Feel free to modify the node as needed.

I have no emotional attachment to the code I have already written. If it is bad and should just be restarted completely, that is fine with me.
